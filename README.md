# 3-cellBoard

### Create and finish functions to generate a 7 x 9 board of 1s and 0s (cells), and code a function to count the number of 1s next to any given cell.

- Create a method to print out a 7 x 9 grid of a randomly generated 2d array with 1s and 0s, with 1 representing a live cell and 0 representing a dead cell.
- Create a method to count the number of live cells neighboring any one cell (that is, the 8 cells surrounding it). This includes overlapping at the edge of the board, so even edge cells still have 8 neighbors.
- Create 5 test cases to test and display accurate results on the console in text.
